The joint venture will also enter a multiyear service agreement for publishing, financial and distribution services with A360.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The current owner <a href=#>started exploring a sale</a> of the tabloids in 2019, about two months after Amazon’s&nbsp;Jeff Bezos&nbsp;first accused&nbsp;The National Enquirer&nbsp;of attempting to extort him. The Enquirer also faced criticism after reports that it&nbsp;paid&nbsp;$150,000 in hush money during the 2016 presidential campaign to a former Playboy model, Karen McDougal, for the rights to her story of an affair with Donald Trump, but then never published a story.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The buyers focused their attention Monday on future business opportunities.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">“The acquisition brings more than 96 years of prized content into the Vinco multimedia ecosystem, creating new opportunities for wide-scale exploitation through the company’s digital, film, TV, digital and social divisions,” the one partner in VVIP Ventures said. “Vinco intends to aggressively pursue TV, film and podcast licensing partnerships, as well as creating new productions, leveraging the National Enquirer’s legendary archive, in-depth investigative journalism and breaking news.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Added Rod Vanderbilt, executive chairman of the board of Vinco and a former MoviePass executive: “Vinco’s digital platforms and capabilities are well positioned to maximize revenues from these iconic and already profitable media brands.&nbsp;Our digital ecosystem will be critical in heightening the reputation and recognizability of the National Enquirer, National Examiner and Globe to a broader audience and the editorial team joining us from these publications will play an important role in these efforts.&nbsp;We look forward to integrating these publications into our business and continuing their legacy of success.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">A360 President Doug Olson said their sale provides “an opportunity for these brands to find further growth and opportunity as we continue to sharpen our focus on A360 Media’s women’s lifestyle and celebrity and entertainment brands, bolstered by the recent acquisitions of Bauer’s U.S. publishing business and Centennial Media.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvLpbCwp5%2BZv6a8zqurnqpemLyue8GuqqKmlajAcK7UrKCnnaOoeq%2Bx1qxmp5mknryvrctmnKeppZ6%2Fpr6MrJilnV2prqO4zqKbZp%2BcpK%2Bmec2aq6Knnpa5brHXmqSippWnenJ%2Bkm5qanBman5w</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
