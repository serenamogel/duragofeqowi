But within a few years, Joseph’s L.A. sojourn was over, and while many of those he had advised were left deeply in debt, Joseph had <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2010/jan/23/joe-kennedy-hollywood-sarah-churchwell data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="pocketed millions of dollars" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">pocketed millions of dollars</a>, which helped fund the next stage in his endlessly ambitious journey — politics.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Joseph’s Hollywood years, however, left a deep impression on his children, who like many other Americans harbored an infatuation with entertainers. His daughter, Patricia, married British-born actor Peter Lawford. And as his son John’s political star began to rise, he became close with a number of entertainers, many of whom he met through Lawford, including a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/celebrities/marilyn-monroe-happy-birthday-mr-president-jfk data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="rumored affair" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">rumored affair</a> with <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/marilyn-monroe data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Marilyn Monroe" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Marilyn Monroe</a> and a <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/john-f-kennedy-frank-sinatra-friendship data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=friendship class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">friendship</a> with one of America’s most popular singers and actors — Sinatra.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Sinatra was as fascinated with politics and power as the Kennedys were with Hollywood and glamour</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A lifelong Democrat, Sinatra had been an ardent campaigner dating back to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/franklin-d-roosevelt data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Franklin Delano Roosevelt" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>’s presidency, and he eagerly threw himself into getting young John elected.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">John’s intelligence, wealth, good looks and cool demeanor, along with his energetic and attractive family, garnered him support throughout much of the entertainment industry, who, along with Sinatra, threw fundraisers, performed at rallies and helped organize for the Kennedy campaign. And while Joseph had a checkered history when it came to race, both Black and white entertainers lined up to support his son, including many who hoped John would tread a far more liberal path with regards to civil rights.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">They were elated when John defeated Vice President <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/political-figures/richard-nixon data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Richard Nixon" class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Richard Nixon</a> in November 1960. Sinatra, who rightly assumed that he had played an important role in JFK’s victory, hatched a plan to bring the worlds of politics and entertainment together by creating an inaugural gala to be held on the eve of John’s inauguration.</p><img alt="Frank Sinatra sits beside songwriter Jimmy Van Husen at the piano during rehearsal for the inaugural gala" title="Frank Sinatra sits beside songwriter Jimmy Van Husen at the piano during rehearsal for the inaugural gala" width=2963 height=2981 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-514880272.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-wuot6e e1geg53v2">Photo: Bettmann/Getty Images</span><p>Frank Sinatra sits beside songwriter Jimmy Van Husen at the piano during rehearsal for the inaugural gala</p><h2 data-node-id=16 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Sammy Davis Jr.'s relationship with a white woman proved politically problematic for the Kennedys</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like Sinatra and the rest of his Hollywood pals, <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/actors/sammy-davis-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sammy Davis Jr." class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">Sammy Davis Jr.</a> threw his support behind JFK. A singer, actor and dancer who’d got his start in show business when he was a toddler, Davis succeeded during an era of deep racial prejudice and discrimination, bristling at how white audiences openly adored him while he was on the stage. However, Davis was also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/davis-sammy-jr data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=criticized class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">criticized</a> by many in the Black community for his willingness to play to what they considered racist stereotypes.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Throughout the 1960 campaign, Davis' personal life was in the headlines, thanks to his romance with white actress May Britt. When the couple announced their engagement in June, the reaction was vicious. In an era when interracial marriages were legally prohibited in dozens of states (the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.history.com/topics/civil-rights-movement/loving-v-virginia data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Loving v.

The Kennedy campaign, largely funded and closely controlled by Joseph, grew fearful of the impact Davis’ notoriety might have on the campaign, thanks in large part to the racist, anti-segregationist, anti-miscegenation views of a large swath of Southern Democrats, without which JFK would lose the election. Davis was <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSTRE66C0YD20100713 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=reportedly class="body-link css-1dhrel9 emevuu60">reportedly</a> pressured to delay his marriage until after the election, and the couple finally wed in mid-November, just days after JFK’s victory.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="css-1a93ikt emevuu60">Davis was invited — and then disinvited — from Sinatra’s gala event</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sinatra pulled together the cream of the crop for the bash.

But as the slate of inaugural events began, a fierce winter storm descended, paralyzing much of the city.
