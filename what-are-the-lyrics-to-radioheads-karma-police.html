The video shows a car chasing a man on foot from the perspective of the driver. Yorke is in the backseat, portraying an angel or devil figure who vanishes at the end. The man getting chased is wearing a corporate uniform, complete with grey pleated pants and a white button-down.</p><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>When the car ultimately catches up to the man, he notices a gas leak and lights a match. The driver is forced to reverse the car but isn’t fast enough, and the vehicle gets torched. According to&nbsp;The Independent, Yorke explained the music video delivers an anti-corporate message:</p><p>“It’s for someone who has to work for a large company. This is a song against bosses.
