Her entrepreneurial path began with Slay by Ella Lash Co., an international sensation in the artificial eyelash market. She is a native of the Bronx, New York. Ella’s unique lash line appeals to beauty fans worldwide with its wide variety of sizes and forms.</strong></p><p>In addition to her financial expertise, Ella has become well-known on social media because of her captivating online persona. Her vibrant personality and business acumen have solidified her position as a significant figure in American popular culture.</p><h2>Ella Bands Before Surgery: Was BBL Present?</h2><p>Ella Bands, an American social media influencer, and businesswoman piqued her followers’ interest with rumors of a Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) procedure before disclosing her plastic surgery procedure. But in her honest conversation about her cosmetic operations, which she shared in her YouTube video “I GOT PLASTIC SURGERY! PT1,” a BBL wasn’t one of them.</p><p>Ella Bands, who gained notoriety for her involvement with A Boogie Wit Da Hoodie, uses her extensive social media following to promote high-end labels such as Dior, Versace, Louis Vuitton, and Fashion Nova. Her impact is evident, as evidenced by her verified Instagram account, which has 2.2 million followers.</p><p>Even though she had over 191,000 subscribers on her YouTube channel, it was inactive in 2019. In addition to her online identity, Bands is the creator of Slay by Ella Lash Company, an enterprise that features finely sculpted, handcrafted eyelashes from quality human hair.</p><p>Her brand has a wide range of collections to suit different shapes and sizes of eyes. Ella Bands’ physical measurements, which are 36-26-36 inches (91-66-91 centimeters), debunk previous allegations about her appearance. Standing at five feet four inches (160 centimeters) and weighing one hundred and thirty pounds (56 kg), her makeover and open story have given her fans a new outlook, solidifying her as a complex figure in American popular culture.</p><h2>Ella Bands Relationship Status</h2><p>The well-known American social media influencer and businesswoman Ella Bands shared a memorable romantic experience with the well-known rapper A Boogie with the Hoodie. The two embarked on a romantic journey together for a significant amount of time before calling it quits.</p><p>A Boogie’s shift was made clear when he expressed his feelings on his Instagram account. Ella Bandz and A Boogie were a popular and dynamic couple during their time together, drawing in fans and followers. But their paths parted, and they were no longer together.</p><p>Rodriguez’s role as a mother of two kids gives her life a deeper depth. Melody Valentine, her older child, is A Boogie’s daughter as well. On February 14, 2017, Melody was born, completing their bond as parents.</p><p>A Boogie and his ex-partner welcomed a kid on June 27, 2020, and named him Artist Julius Dubose Jr., thereby growing their family even more. This was a happy occasion for the pair, even though they eventually parted ways.</p><p>Ella Bands’s public persona has been enhanced by her journey and parenthood, which highlight her varied existence outside of her business and social media prominence. Their shared experiences as parents continue to influence their narratives, even though her relationship with A Boogie has changed over time.</p><p><strong>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Shelby Holliday</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Yoon Chan Young</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Hailey Peters</a>.</strong></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>social media influencer</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Emily Ratajkowski | Husband Sebastian Bear-McClard</a></h3>It's hard to imagine how swiftly Emily Ratajkowski, a London native, married Sebastian Bear-McClard.
