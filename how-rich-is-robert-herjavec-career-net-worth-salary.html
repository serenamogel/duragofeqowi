Mark Cuban, Lori Greiner, Barbara Corcoran, Daymond John, Kevin O’Leary, and Robert Herjavec are among the judges on the panel. Herjavec is a well-known corporate leader in North America, with a net worth of about $200 million as of April 2023.

The majority of the entrepreneur’s wealth has come through his business activities and enterprises.&nbsp;Although this is an immigrant success story, Robert was a low-wage laborer after graduating from the University of Toronto. Robert, who earned degrees in Political Science and English Literature, was forced to work for minimum pay in order to maintain his family.</p><p>Following that, he worked as a third AD (assistant director) until switching jobs and selling computer equipment for Logiquest. Robert rose through the ranks to become the company’s general manager.&nbsp;The entrepreneur quit Logiquest in 1990 to create his own firm, BRAK Systems. The firm, which was founded in his basement, specialized in internet security software. AT&T Canada purchased the firm for more than $30 million in 2000, ten years after it was created.&nbsp;Following his achievement, Herjavec took a break from entrepreneurship and accepted a job as VP of Sales at Ramp Network. However, in 2003, he resumed work at his own company, The Herjavec Group.</p><p>The firm is Canada’s largest supplier of IT security services and specializes in internet security solutions and services. The firm started modestly, with $400,000 in revenue in its first year, but it has only grown since then. The Herjavec Group was estimated to generate $200 million in yearly sales in 2017.&nbsp;The Shark Tank judge does more than just business; he has written a number of self-help and financial guidance books. Driven: How to Succeed in Business and Life, his debut book was published in 2010. This was followed in 2013 by The Will to Win: Leading, Competing and Succeeding. Herjavec has also delivered a number of talks based on the themes presented in his second book.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=he-published-you-dont-have-to-be-a-shark-creating-your-own-success-his-third-book-in-2016></span>He published You Don’t Have to Be a Shark: Creating Your Own Success, his third book In 2016.<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Robert Herjavec has participated in both Shark Tank and Dragon’s Den, where he has invested in a number of participants’ ideas. He made a $100,000 investment in Tipsy Elves in return for a 10% stake. This proved to be a wise investment for him since the firm reported $70 million in revenues since its inception in 2018.&nbsp;The Shark Tank USA debut will air on ABC on September 23 at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKCfrHqztcKhZKKrXae8o7HRrWShnaKfrrexwmaamqqVmr9uusStZLCnoqm1br%2FApZirsV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
