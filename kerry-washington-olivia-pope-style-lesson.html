And although the star's wardrobe is equally as envy-inducing IRL, Washington says she's still learned a thing or two from Pope's highly-coveted onscreen style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">What's the most important lesson she's taken from her character? "The importance of a great tailor," Washington told InStyle at an event for the AllState Purple Purse Foundation, for which she <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>designed a limited-edition bag</a> to help fight domestic abuse. "I think so often we drive ourselves crazy because we expect something to fit us perfectly off the rack and that’s just not the case. Every woman is beautiful in her own unique way and there are hundreds of millions of different kinds of bodies in the world and so it makes sense."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But the the Golden Globe- and Emmy-nominated actress says it doesn't have to be a complicated process. "Even if it’s just your neighborhood tailor, it makes sense to have somebody in your life who can do alterations so that you put things on that are perfect for you and to not feel bad because you put something on and it’s not perfect. That’s not about you. That’s about that garment."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We're guessing that's part of the reason why every look she sports on the red carpet (including her <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>maternity style</a>) is decidedly flawless. And she pulls off risky looks like it's second nature. "What I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>wore to the Emmy's this year</a> [was probably the riskiest look I've ever worn] because it was so see-through," she laughs. "Yeah, that was pretty risky. But it was great for me because I had very little clothing on and it was so hot that day, so it worked out quite well. That, and my crop top that I <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>wore when I was pregnant</a>—that was definitely risky!"</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">We certainly hope you keep it up, Kerry.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>PHOTOS: See the Purse That Kerry Washington Designed for Charity</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGebmr%2BzxYywmKygmaO0tbvNZqaloaaerm68zqmcZqukrrmmecueqqynng%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
