A big question fans had was what happened to Bubbles as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">casting news</a> saw a new child services agent being added to the mix. Jolene Purdy is joining Lilo and Stitch as child services agent Mrs. Kekoa, and fans were distraught at the idea that we’d have a reboot without one of the most beloved Disney characters ever.</p><p data-characters=434 data-current-count=434 data-injectable=true>Things changed ever-so-slightly when news broke this afternoon that Bubbles is back, but it’s not the warm welcome fans were initially hoping to hand over, and here’s why. Ving Rhames was the voice of the iconic character, who appeared even to be molded after the actor, but Rhames isn’t the one who will be portraying the child services agent in the live-action reboot. Instead, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Courtney Vance has landed the role</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>So they didn’t get rid of Bubbles, but they still could not bring back his original voice actor, Ving Rhames. Who already looks exactly like his animated counterpart 😐 <a href=#>https://t.co/5KqQfM3wRm</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zPezdu2k9i</a></p>— Diego Alarcon (@DiegoApic) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=697 data-injectable=true>Now, Vance is a talented actor with many accolades and has breathed life into some incredible characters in the entertainment realm, and no one can deny that. In fact, it seems strange to be upset about bringing such talent into the Lilo & Stitch realm, but with a character as iconic as Bubbles, fans are wondering why Disney isn’t casting Rhames in the role he helped shape initially.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I love courtney but why not just cast ving rhames … Disney over there doing anything <a href=#>https://t.co/iGamG79rsN</a></p>— Lightening McQueen (@bigfacebritt) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=624 data-injectable=true>Much of the chatter surrounding Vance’s casting is positive, and rightfully so; it’s important to note that fans know he’s more than capable of bringing something unique to the role. The thing is, it just feels wrong not to get Rhames back for the live-action retelling; it almost feels like a disservice.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The casting directors saw the lashings they were getting on social media and had come up with something quick. I’m happy for Courtney B. Vance.

It’s possible he was asked but said no for whatever reason. While fans are ready to cause a stir — and rightfully so — everyone might want to hold onto their spoons for just a moment.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=678 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Funny how everyone losing their minds about Ving Rhames not being cast without even knowing if Ving turned down the role 🤷🏽‍♂️ <a href=#>https://t.co/SLKoMmf0eO</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/93avbW2iV8</a></p>— Brooklyn (@BrooklynBoyB) <a href=#>April 19, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=368 data-current-count=368 data-injectable=false>Ultimately, fans are excited that Bubbles is still part of the Lilo & Stitch realm because let’s face it — the movies wouldn’t be the same without him. While Lilo and Stitch are both iconic characters, you can’t think of the film without thinking of Bubbles, he carved out a die-hard fan base, and they’re still holding a candle for him.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=668 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>It’s a start!
