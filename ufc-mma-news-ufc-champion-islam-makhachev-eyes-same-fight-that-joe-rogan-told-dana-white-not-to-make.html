While speaking to BT sport, the Russian even named the fighter that he would like to face next. And although there is yet to be any decision made on <strong>Makhachev</strong>‘s future, his expressing the desire to face another top contender just displays the type of character that he is built of.</p><p>What makes this call-out interesting is that as per UFC legend <strong>Chael Sonnen</strong>, it was a <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>fight that was once disapproved by commentator <strong>Joe Rogan</strong></a>. And though <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Rogan</a></strong> is not a matchmaker, his relationship with President <strong><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Dana White</a></strong> could have played an influence in this scenario. Despite this, <strong>Makhachev</strong> has shown his choice of opponent for his next title defense, and it’s more than likely that the promotion would go ahead with the match-up in the near future.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Islam Makhachev claims Beneil Dariush is a worthy contender; wants to fight him next</h2><p>Coming off a hard-fought victory that many felt could have gone either way; the 31-year-old expressed his continuing desire to face the toughest challengers in the division. When asked who he wanted to face next, <strong>Makhachev</strong> named fourth-ranked <strong>Beneil Dariush</strong> as the ideal candidate.</p><p><strong>Dariush</strong> riding an eight-fight win streak is clearly one of the toughest match-ups for the Lightweight champ; when looked at from a style perspective. But despite such technical challenges, he expressed his belief that the 33-year-old deserves a title shot. Despite naming him, <strong>Makhachev</strong> eventually stated that he would face anyone the UFC offered him.</p><p><span>Talking about <strong>Dariush</strong>‘s upcoming fight against former champ <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Charles Oliveira</strong></a>, he said,</span><span> “I hope Beneil wins. Because I already beat Oliveira and I need some new challenge.”</span></p><p>Also reiterating his desire to face the American, he pointed out his impressive skill set.</p><p><span>“Dariush is going to be a good fight because this guy has good skills. Striking skills, wrestling skills, and grappling skills. That’s why it’s going to be a good fight.” </span><span>explained <strong>Makhachev</strong></span><span>.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>UFC legend Chael Sonnen earlier claimed it was Joe Rogan who wanted this fight to not go ahead</strong></h2><p>Now what makes this match intriguing was the fact that it was set to take place even before <strong>Makhachev</strong> had won the title. And former UFC fighter <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><strong>Chael Sonnen</strong></a> also covered this in one of his videos. <strong>Sonnen</strong> claimed that despite the fact that the fight was very close to taking place, <strong>Joe Rogan</strong> had suggested against it to the UFC boss.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/GettyImages-1006861360.jpg><p>His exact words were, “<span>Dana says, ‘I was gonna [islam vs charles] and Joe Rogan just grabbed me and told me not to’. That was just interesting.”</span></p><p>Although the legend himself wondered why that happened, considering that <strong>Rogan</strong> was not a part of matchmaking; he went on to claim that maybe the commentator believed they didn’t have to necessarily cancel each other out before fighting for the title.</p><p><span>“I think what Joe’s belief was is ‘Hey, put Islam in a title fight. Once that gets situated; bring Benny in. Don’t have them eliminate each other now in contendership. Do it for a championship,’” </span><span>explained <strong>Sonnen</strong></span><span>.</span></p><p>Despite whatever happened earlier, <strong>Makhachev</strong> is clearly looking for a challenge in his next title defense. And if Dariush is good enough to go past the talented Oliveira fans might get to experience yet another masterpiece in the Lightweight division.</p><p><strong>Watch This Story: <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>UFC 284: Fighters react to Volkanovski vs. Makhachev controversial decision</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9SfmmalnZZ6r7HWrGSunpNisKmtzKmgqKZdnsCtrcxmpJqjmJawqbHVZpyynaNiwKK5xGadop%2BYqXq1tMCtZKOnlWK%2FsLPAp2Stp5yZeqWtzZpksKCZqbJuus6tZK2nXaKurLGO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
