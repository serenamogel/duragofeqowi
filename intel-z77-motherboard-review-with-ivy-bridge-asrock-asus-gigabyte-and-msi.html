Over the past several motherboard generations, I have not been that impressed with Gigabyte's offering in terms of extras - this is because in order to hit a price point, sometimes the extras in the box are not the focus of the product.  With the Z77X-UD3H, we are hoping for at least some good stuff here.

This represents the direct correlation between the Load Line Calibration and how the processor/motherboard deals with voltage requests while under load. &nbsp;This is not to be confused with the quality of power delivery, but more an indication of how aggressive the default LLC settings are on a motherboard.</p><p align=center><a href=#><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/5793/GigabyteZ77X-UD3HVCoreRipple_575px.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The response of the Gigabyte board under load is fantastic.&nbsp; No ripple at all and a lower average voltage than the ASUS P8P77-V Pro.</p><p><strong>Overclocking</strong></p><p><strong>Note: </strong>Ivy Bridge does not overclock like Sandy Bridge.&nbsp; For a detailed report on the effect of voltage on Ivy Bridge (and thus temperatures and power draw), please read <a href=#>Undervolting and Overclocking on Ivy Bridge</a>.</p><p>The Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD3H has a variety of overclocking tools at the disposal of the user.&nbsp; Automatic overclocks are through EasyTune6, where we experienced a rather good result with our chip with Gigabyte's auto tuning software, and manual overclocks are either performed through the BIOS (with a series of menu jumps which should have been more carefully laid out), or using a new Gigabyte tool called TweakLauncher.&nbsp; I have not previewed TweakLauncher here, as it is primarily for sub-zero overclockers wanting real-time access to changes in performance while under extreme temperatures.&nbsp; It forgoes the usual GUI interface and sliders with something more amenable to the competitive overclocker - it is not suitable for the majority of users.</p><p><strong>Auto Overclock</strong>: Using the Auto Tuning option in EasyTune6, the software pulled up a large screen and offered a confirmation of a stress-tested overclock.&nbsp; When clicked yes, the system would stability test a range of BCLK and Multipliers until the board resets or the system finds it unstable.&nbsp; When this had finished, the board offered me a 46x104.5 overclock (4810 MHz).&nbsp; I discovered that turbo modes still applied, so this speed was the single thread speed, and the CPU would reduce the multiplier by two for multithreaded loads, giving 4589 MHz).&nbsp; This gave 1.236 volts at load, which could be a little high, but due to the lower speed under multithreaded load, the CPU only reached 84ºC under PovRay and was completely stable.&nbsp; I enjoyed this result a lot from an automatic overclock!</p><p><strong>Manual Overclock</strong>: Due to the way Ivy Bridge behaves with increased voltage, for a manual overclock, I am testing the peak overclock at a variety of voltages as well as the temperatures at that voltage.&nbsp; On the Gigabyte board, the CPU load line calibration was set to Extreme and Intel Speed Step was disabled.&nbsp; One interesting thing to note was that Gigabyte set this board to 100.9 MHz default on the BCLK, rather than 100.0 MHz.&nbsp; When the multiplier is pushed above 44x, this is reduced to 100.0 MHz.</p><p>At 1.100 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 45x, giving 4.5 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 70ºC at load with PovRay, and showed a load voltage of 1.116 volts.</p><p>At 1.150 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 46x, giving 4.6 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 75ºC at load with PovRay, and showed a load voltage of 1.164 volts.</p><p>At 1.200 volts, the highest multiplier that was stable was 47x, giving 4.7 GHz.&nbsp; This gave 82ºC with PovRay, 86ºC with OCCT, and a load voltage of 1.212 volts.</p><p>At 1.250 volts, the board successfully booted at 4.8 GHz, with 1.272 volts under load and 89ºC with PovRay - but this was not stable due to the memory errors in PovRay, suggesting more voltage is required.&nbsp; Given the current load temperature, I was unwilling to push the voltage further.</p><p>In terms of memory, when attempting to overclock a G.Skill 2x4 DDR3-2666 kit, which performed 2950 MHz on the ASUS P8Z77-V Pro, it would not boot at the DDR3-2800 strap despite all the correct timings being entered.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIJ4hZJooKeslaF6u4OWZqSorJiav6O7wKubZqqVq7amw4ywoK2gXZ7DunnBq6Cdn5VirrS%2BzpyiZpmjqsBus8igmJuxpJp6orrDZqSsoV9u</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
