Our industry our community, and his amazing family are all now left with a hole that is just filled with grief, shock, and sadness. Benjamin Nothstine was and will continue to be an exemplary model for someone with a true, loving, caring, genuine heart. I had the pleasure of working with him and while it was only for a short time he made a lasting impression. The first day that I met Ben I told him he reminded me of my older brother. From his mannerisms to his passion in debating any topic, and the way that he would always ask what he could do for you before doing for himself! I think what will be missed the most is his sincere desire to leave any room and conversation happier than when he walked in! Every single time we would hang up the phone or I would just walk to my office down the hall, you would hear him tell anyone love you mean it. To his wife and his amazing beautiful daughter. I hope that you find peace in the coming days and know that you have an entire community rallying for you with you and behind you.</p><p>A GoFundMe has been created to help generates funds for the family</p><h5>See more:<a href=#>Kelly Wussow Obituary, Pac Knife Sales Team Office Manager</a></h5>Hello, my name is Katie Nothstine. I’m one of two sisters of Ben Nothstine. I am so deeply torn to say Ben is no longer with us. Ben has a wife and 1 yr old daughter who during these horrible times needs everyone’s help to cover costs for the funeral and memorial services as well as any bills over the next coming months. This is soul crushing to everyone who knew Ben as he always tried his best to hide the demons he was fighting inside. He was so deeply loved my family and friends And we are all having a extremely hard time accepting the reality of this. The money being donated will go to his wife Elyse Nothstine and daughter Charlotte to help cover any costs relating to his death and financial help as monthly bills start to come in during this time. Thank you in advance to anyone who can give anything. Please help our family in this time of need Our heartfelt condolences go out to the deceased’s family and friends, who have been struggling with the loss of such an intelligent and compassionate individual.<p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
