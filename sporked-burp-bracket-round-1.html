If we’ve learned anything as professional taste testers and food journalists here at Sporked, it’s that people have very strong opinions about soda. They’re passionate about Dr Pepper. Mad about Mtn Dew. But loyalties run even deeper when it comes to regional sodas, those hometown favorites you grew up on that people in less fortunate regions of the U.S. might be wholly unfamiliar with."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

They’re passionate about <a href=#>Dr Pepper</a>. Mad about <a href=#>Mtn Dew</a>. But loyalties run even deeper when it comes to regional sodas, those hometown favorites you grew up on that people in less fortunate regions of the U.S. might be wholly unfamiliar with. But what’s the best regional soda of them all? Well, we suspect you’ll have a lot of opinions about that.&nbsp;</p><p>Welcome to the <strong>Burp Bracket</strong>, your chance to weigh in on the best regional sodas. The contenders: Boylan Black Cherry representing the Mid-Atlantic, Faygo Rock & Rye representing the Midwest, Cheerwine representing the Southeast, Shasta Tiki Punch representing the West, Big Red representing the Southwest, Dr. Brown’s Cream Soda representing the Northeast, Jones Cream Soda representing the Northwest, and, last but not least, Izze Sparkling Blackberry representing the Mountain region.&nbsp;</p><p>To select a soda for each region, we put our heads together and picked the most iconic brands. If the brand makes sodas in more than one flavor, we asked our followers on Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram to help us pick the best flavor of them all. So if Faygo Rock & Rye is not the best flavor of Faygo in your opinion, take it up with them!</p><p>This week, it’s round one. Choose a winner of each match-up—based either on your regional loyalties or your honest opinions—and then come back next week to find out which sodas are moving on to the next round, and vote again. The round one match-ups are as follows:</p><p><strong>Boylan Black Cherry</strong> vs. <strong>Faygo Rock & Rye</strong></p><p><strong>Cheerwine</strong> vs. <strong>Shasta Tiki Punch</strong></p><p><strong>Big Red</strong> vs. <strong>Dr. Brown’s Cream Soda</strong></p><p><strong>Jones Cream Soda</strong> vs. <strong>Izze Sparkling Blackberry</strong></p><p>After four rounds, we’ll have a winner decided by you and one decided by the Sporked team, too.
