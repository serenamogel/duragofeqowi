Indeed, this isn’t the first time Warner Bros. is said to have eyed up the Pirates of the Caribbean star to play Gotham’s Clown Prince. In fact, WGTC told you months ago that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he might be playing the Joker</a>. Though at the time, we had heard that he was being eyed for Matt Reeves’ trilogy. However, it seems the idea of casting him in Beyond instead appears to have just dawned on them.</p><p>“[We’ve] been hearing about discussions for Johnny Depp as the Joker so much lately that he was convinced they were targeting him for Matt Reeves’ Batman trilogy,” says Sutton. “That might not be the case. They haven’t negotiated with Depp yet but WB [could be] planning on nabbing him for Batman Beyond as the world’s most famous psychotic clown.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/batman-beyond-keaton.jpg><p data-characters=593 data-current-count=593 data-injectable=true>Sutton’s latest leak also lines up with our previous report that <strong>Batman Beyond</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">will be an adaptation of Return of the Joker,</a>&nbsp;the animated feature film released in 2000. No doubt Bat fans are now getting excited about the prospect of Keaton as an aged Bruce Wayne, Depp opposite him as the Joker and a younger actor playing Terry McGinnis, with Burton back in the director’s chair. Apparently, the project was originally being lined up for HBO Max, but it sounds like the possibility of having Keaton on board has convinced the powers that be to upgrade it to a theatrical release.</p><p data-characters=470 data-current-count=470 data-injectable=false>These plans could, of course, completely unravel if Keaton turns down the chance to play the Caped Crusader again, but if he does sign on the dotted line, the possibility of Burton also returning to the character isn’t completely out of the question, nor is Depp following him in tow. Here’s hoping there’s something to these rumors, because it sure sounds like DC and Warner Bros. may have found their dream team for a live-action Return of the Joker.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooaignqPGbrDEqadmqqWivLa%2BxJ1ko6ebmr9uvs6lnGaakam6orqMpqavoZVk</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
