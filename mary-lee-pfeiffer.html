Thus, it’s likely that <strong>Tom</strong>‘s net worth is going to increase in the coming days.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=tumultuous-married-life></span>Tumultuous married life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Mary</strong> got married to <strong>Thomas Cruise Mapother III</strong>, who was an electrical engineer in <i>1974</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>She has not said anything about her husband, but her son <strong>Tom</strong> has revealed that <strong>Mary</strong> lived a tumultuous married life with <strong>Thomas</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>He failed to support his family and fulfill his responsibility towards them. It’s far for <strong>Thomas</strong> to nourish and guide family; rather, he had made their life harsh.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Mary </strong>alone used to work three jobs per day to give a suitable life to her children. That’s why <strong>Tom</strong> kept praising Mary and was very close to her.&nbsp;</p><p>Finally, to end one of her sufferings, she separated from him and went through a divorce in <i>1974</i>. Now, <strong>Thomas</strong> is no more with them. In <i>1984</i>, he died because of Cancer.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=the-husband-was-a-bully></span>The husband was a bully<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Mary</strong>‘s husband was not there for her when she needed him most.

Unfortunately, this wedding also could last for long.&nbsp;</p><p>She got divorced from him in <i>2010</i>. However, the reason for this separation is still unknown. After battling with chronic pulmonary disease, the <strong>South</strong> died in <i>July 2015</i>.&nbsp;</p><p>But the surprising fact is that both <strong>Mary</strong> and his son <strong>Tom</strong> were not present at his funeral.&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=cause-of-death></span>Cause of death<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><strong>Mary</strong> was <i>80</i> years old when she left this world in <i>February 2017</i> peacefully while she was sleeping in her bed.&nbsp;</p><p>Different sources claimed that she was struggling with health problems for a long time, and the illness became the cause of her death.&nbsp;</p><p>However, what type of illness she was suffering is still unknown.
