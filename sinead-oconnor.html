She went on to receive eight Grammy Award nominations, including a win in 1991 for Best Alternative Album with I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got. However, with fame came controversy. Among other incidents, O’Connor tore up a picture of the pope during an appearance on Saturday Night Live in 1992 and, more recently, had been known for using social media to express her personal struggles. O’Connor died at age 56 in July 2023.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 title="Quick Facts" data-anchor-id=quick-facts class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Quick Facts</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="body-tip css-i9osfz e1k3dme10">FULL NAME: Sinéad Marie Bernadette O’Connor<br>BORN: December 8, 1966<br>DIED: July 26, 2023<br>BIRTHPLACE: Dublin, Ireland<br>SPOUSES: John Reynolds (1987-1991), Nick Sommerlad (2001-2004), Steve Cooney (2010-2011), and Barry Herridge (2011)<br>CHILDREN: Jake, Roisin, Shane, and Yeshua<br>ASTROLOGICAL SIGN: Sagittarius</p><h2 data-node-id=10 title="Early Life" data-anchor-id=early-life class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Early Life</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Born December 8, 1966, in Dublin, Sinéad Marie Bernadette O’Connor had a difficult childhood. Her parents divorced early on, and her mother was frequently abusive. O’Connor was sent to reform school after being caught shoplifting.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her music career began when she was discovered by the drummer of the popular Irish band In Tua Nua and co-wrote their hit song “Take My Hand.” Before finishing school, O’Connor ran away to Dublin, where she sang and played guitar on the street and in pubs and worked for a singing telegram service.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 title="Breakthrough with “Nothing Compares 2 U“" data-anchor-id=breakthrough-with-nothing-compares-2-u class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Breakthrough with “Nothing Compares 2 U“</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">While performing with a Dublin band called Ton Ton Macoute, O’Connor caught the attention of the two owner-managers of the small London record label Ensign Records. Ensign released her debut album, The Lion and the Cobra, in late 1987. Critics lauded O’Connor’s powerful and expressive voice and noted the complexity of her songs, even while acknowledging their decidedly uncommercial nature. Although it had no major hit singles, the album eventually sold more than 500,000 copies and went platinum.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">With the 1990 release of O’Connor’s second album, I Do Not Want What I Haven’t Got, she became an international star. Driven by the phenomenal success of the smash hit single “Nothing Compares 2 U” (a once-obscure song written by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/musicians/prince data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Prince class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Prince</a> and first recorded by a band called the Family), the album shot to the top of the Billboard charts and nabbed O’Connor four Grammy Award nominations including Best Album, Best Song, Best Female Vocalist, and Best Alternative Album. The video for “Nothing Compares 2 U” won the MTV Award for Video of the Year, and O’Connor was named Artist of the Year in 1991 by Rolling Stone.</p><h6 class="css-9e7625 e9ikml3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e9ikml1">Other Irish Singers</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=17 title="Controversies: SNL and the Pope" data-anchor-id=controversies-snl-and-the-pope class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Controversies: SNL and the Pope</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Her next two albums, Am I Not Your Girl? (1992) and Universal Mother (1994), made far less of an impact critically and commercially. But before that, O’Connor was becoming famous for her controversial public outbursts, beginning in 1989 when she announced her support for the radical Irish Republican Army. She retracted the statement one year later.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">She again made headlines in 1990 when she refused to appear on stage in New Jersey if “The Star-Spangled Banner” was played before the concert. In 1991, O’Connor boycotted the Grammy ceremony and refused her award for Best Alternative Album, maintaining that her absence was a protest against the extreme commercialism of the Grammy Awards.</p><img alt="sinead o connor playing a guitar during her performance on saturday night live" title="Sinead O'Connor on Saturday Night Live" width=1956 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/episode-1-pictured-musical-guest-sinead-oconnor-performs-on-news-photo-1690400067.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Sinéad O’Connor performs on Saturday Night Live in September 1990. In another appearance on the show two years later, the singer famously tore a photo of Pope John Paul II.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Even more publicity surrounded O’Connor’s 1992 performance on Saturday Night Live, during which she tore up a photograph of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.biography.com/religious-figures/john-paul-ii data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Pope John Paul II" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Pope John Paul II</a>, denouncing the Catholic Church as “the real enemy.” Despite her contempt for the clerical hierarchy and to bring attention toward allegations of child abuse within the institution, O’Connor maintained she was a Catholic and devoutly spiritual.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“It’s not the man, obviously—it’s the office and the symbol of the organization that he represents,” the singer stated in <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976937,00.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="a 1992 interview with Time magazine" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">a 1992 interview with Time magazine</a>. “I consider them to be responsible for the destruction of entire races of people and the subsequent existence of domestic and child abuse in every country they went into.”</p><h2 data-node-id=23 title="Children, Spouses, and Personal Challenges" data-anchor-id=children-spouses-and-personal-challenges class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Children, Spouses, and Personal Challenges</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Aside from the release of her 1997 single “Gospel Oak,” O’Connor’s recording career faltered in the late 1990s, eclipsed by the turmoil in the singer’s private life.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 1995, an extended custody battle began between O’Connor and her ex John Waters, an Irish journalist, over their infant daughter, Roisin. Plagued by Waters’ bitter accusations that she was an unfit mother, O’Connor attempted suicide in March 1999. While recovering, O’Connor agreed to let Roisin live with Waters in Dublin. A few days later, however, she snatched the girl from Waters’ home and flew with her back to London.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In addition to Roisin, O’Connor had three sons. Her oldest child, Jake, was born in 1987 to the singer and her first husband John Reynolds. She and Irish trad musician Donal Lunny welcomed Shane in 2004. Yeshua, born to O’Connor and Frank Bonadio, arrived in 2006.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">After a whirlwind romance, O’Connor married British journalist Nick Sommerlad in a secret ceremony in the summer of 2001, but the union didn’t last, and the pair soon split up.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">Meanwhile, O’Connor made headlines in an altogether different way. In April 1999, she was ordained as the first-ever priestess of the Latin Tridentine Church, a dissident Catholic group led by a self-styled Roman Catholic bishop from Ireland named Michael Cox. In April 2000, Mother Bernadette Marie—O’Connor’s clerical name—was elevated to Archdeacon for her work with Dublin’s homeless.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2010, O’Connor once again tried for wedded bliss. She married friend and frequent collaborator Steve Cooney that year, but the pair called it quits the following spring. Undeterred from finding her happily ever after, O’Connor married for the fourth time in December 2011. She and Barry Herridge tied the knot in Las Vegas, but she announced that the marriage was over after only 18 days.</p><h2 data-node-id=30 title="Later Years and Son’s Death" data-anchor-id=later-years-and-sons-death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Later Years and Son’s Death</h2><img alt="sinead o connor performing on stage singing into a microphone" title="Singer Sinead O'Connor dies at age 56 " width=3000 height=2015 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sinead-oconnor-performs-at-august-hall-on-february-07-2020-news-photo-1690402085.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-eqbp25 eewc14j1">Getty Images</span><p>Sinéad O’Connor performs at San Francisco’s August Hall in February 2020.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2000, O’Connor signed with Atlantic Records. Her first album in six years, Faith & Courage, was released later that year. She went on to release an album of traditional Irish music, Sean-Nós Nua, in 2002.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=33 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O’Connor announced that she was retiring from music in 2003. She Who Dwells in the Secret Place of the Most High Shall Abide Under the Shadow of the Almighty (2003) was supposed to be her last album. According to People magazine, O’Connor posted this message on her website: “I am a very shy person, believe it or not. So I ask with love, that I be left in peace and privacy by people who love my records too.”<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=34 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O’Connor’s retirement didn’t last long. In 2005, she released the reggae-influenced Throw Down Your Arms. O’Connor continued to produce new music with 2007’s Theology. She earned strong reviews for her 2012 effort How About I Be Me (And You Be You)? Her next record, I’m Not Bossy, I’m the Boss (2014), also received a warm reception.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=35 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In late 2015, O’Connor experienced some type of mental health crisis. She wrote two notes indicating that she was suicidal on her Facebook page before her family requested that the page be taken down. O’Connor was reportedly hospitalized after her first Facebook post.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In May 2016, O’Connor went missing for a day while biking in Chicago, only to be found by authorities soon after. She then proceeded to write about her personal struggles again on Facebook, this time with a scathing attack on her family, blaming them for her mental health crisis.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=37 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">In 2018, O’Connor converted to Islam and <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-12341117/Sinead-OConnor-dead-Irish-music-legend-dies-aged-56-years-mental-health-battles-18-months-17-year-old-son-Shane-passed-away.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="changed her name" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">changed her name</a> to Shuhada’ Sadaqat.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O’Connor experienced a personal tragedy four years later in January 2022 when her son Shane, then age 17, died by suicide.</p><h2 data-node-id=39 title=Death data-anchor-id=death class="body-h2 css-a5dq20 e1iypdkw1">Death</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=40 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">O’Connor was found dead inside a residential property on July 26, 2023, in London.
