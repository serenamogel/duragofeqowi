Stagnation and moral rot are as hot and heavy as the air itself, and there are little monsters scurrying everywhere. A husband and father haunts a seamy porno Web site. A convicted child molester lurks beneath the surface of the public pool. A raging bully prowls the streets after dark, stalking his scapegoat with unfathomable fury. These people sweat guilt, paranoia and recrimination; the bad feelings bead up on their skin but won't evaporate.</p><p>It's an odd and squirmy movie, in some ways as slick and facile as "<a href=#>American Beauty</a>." But that movie had an empty plastic bag for a heart, and "Little Children" is more than arch yuppie satire -- though it's that, too. There's a humane sensibility beneath the surface that's simultaneously sympathetic and fiercely judgmental. Maybe it's that New England Puritanism, angels and devils endlessly wrestling.</p><p>The characters, all of whom share a mind-boggling immaturity, break down (and break up) into couples: Sarah (<a href=#>Kate Winslet</a>) is a mom with a master's degree in literature who feels closer to <i>Madame Bovary</i> than she does to her young daughter, whom she views as an alien being. She's married to Richard (<a href=#>Gregg Edelman</a>), an older and extremely unattractive person. This marriage is a contrivance, which exists only so Sarah can feel an overwhelming compulsion to leave it.</p><p>Brad (<a href=#>Patrick Wilson</a>), the househusband and former Golden Boy whom the women at Kate's playground nickname the Prom King, is great with his son -- but not so much with his coldly pretty wife Kathy (<a href=#>Jennifer Connelly</a>), a manipulative documentary filmmaker whose brittle exterior doesn't quite conceal the soul of a shark. Like Sarah with her books, Kathy has more feelings for a child she interviews for her film than the one in bed beside her. They are a perfect-looking family. So, you know that can't last.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmq52mnrK4v46loK2snJp6pLTIpZurnZ5if3F8lQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
