That’s right, he was set to suit up as the Scarlet Speedster before the studio pulled the plug. While speaking with Yahoo, the actor couldn’t help expressing regret, saying:</p><p>“In hindsight, I should’ve been more bummed [at the time]. I really liked it. But I just kind of felt like, ‘No big deal. The next thing will come.’ And it kind of did, but it kind of didn’t. But nothing like that came along again.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-lineup-1.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-superman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jlm-batman.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/dj-cotrona-superman.jpg><p data-characters=104 data-current-count=104 data-injectable=false>Like most folks involved with the production, Brody had good things to say about the screenplay, adding:</p><p>“The script was really good.&nbsp;It’s not that it was revolutionary, and I’m pretty objective about this kind of thing, and I think I have a pretty good gauge of scripts. I thought the casting was right. Not just me, but everyone, tonally, was going to fit right.”</p><p data-characters=567 data-current-count=671 data-injectable=false>Although a timeline wherein <strong>Justice League Mortal</strong> made it to screen ultimately meant never seeing Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman or Jason Momoa as Aquaman, it’s fun to ponder what might have been. Yes, I did think the Justice League movie we got in 2017 was fun to watch, but it wasn’t quite what I’d hoped for. Miller’s vision, however, sounded like a grand slam. Plus, one has to wonder how differently the Marvel/DC rivalry would’ve unfolded if the first major superhero team-up picture arrived in 2009, as opposed to The Avengers in 2012.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomJ2ZnWKvs7vDsmSrnZahsqTA0manpZmpnruoecWlmKygXZ%2FCtMDInJxmpJWWtLaxjKamq6yRoXw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
