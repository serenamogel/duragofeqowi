It’s different.”</p><p>The pregnant star also has her “excited” daughter at home awaiting the little one’s arrival. “She’s owning this so much,” Dewan told Us in October. “<a href=#>She tells everybody in the world</a>, anyone and everyone. She tells everyone she sees, ‘Did you know I’m going to be a big sister?’ She’s so happy.
