Sitting on top of the coffin was a card simply reading: “Mummy.”
A million people lined the streets from Kensington Palace to the church—and estimates of up to 2.5 billion watched live on television—to honor the memory of Princess Diana, who had tragically died in a car accident in Paris on August 31, 1997."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

We wanted to see the impact we could have,” Prince William said in the GQ piece.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 e1k3dme10">“Practically everything in my charitable life, in the end, is to do with mental health, whether it be homelessness, veterans' welfare, my wife and the work she is doing on addiction; so much of what we do comes back to mental health,” he continued. “Harry has the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://invictusgamesfoundation.org data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Invictus Games" class="body-link css-9lyfaf e1k3dme10">Invictus Games</a> and focuses a lot on veterans.
