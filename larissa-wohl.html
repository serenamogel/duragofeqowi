But she didn’t give her fans an insight into her personal life. She tweeted about dating someone in 2009, but she preferred to keep the name a secret.</p><p>However, she made the name public almost a year later. Alec Shankman was the lucky recipient of the lovely journalist. Her boyfriend’s identity was revealed on Twitter on August 4, 2010.</p><p>The dating couple was so attracted to each other that fans of Larissa began to speculate that she might be her husband-prospect. Until 2013, the relationship drew public attention. Following that, they abruptly went low-key.</p><p>They did not marry or even get engaged, as many expected. She has no joint activities with her long-term boyfriend as of February 2020, according to her Instagram account.</p><p>Perhaps she had a secret wedding, tying the knot in a private setting. In any case, stay tuned as we will keep you updated on any new developments in the life of the Pet-rescue expert.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read, Cecilia Allman, Marian Krawstor, and Bronlie Jacobs."}' data-sheets-userformat='{"2":4480,"10":2,"11":0,"15":"Arial"}' data-sheets-textstyleruns='{"1":0}{"1":11,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":{"2":{"1":2,"2":0}}}{"1":62}' data-sheets-hyperlinkruns='{"1":11,"2":"https://popularbio.com/cecilia-allman/"}{"1":25}{"1":27,"2":"https://popularbio.com/marian-krawstor/"}{"1":42}{"1":48,"2":"https://popularbio.com/bronlie-jacobs/"}{"1":62}'>Also Read, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Cecilia Allman</a>, <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Marian Krawstor</a>, and <a class=in-cell-link href=# rel=noopener>Bronlie Jacobs</a>.`</span></p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag>TV personality</a></span> <a href=#></a><h3 class=small-font><a href=#>Gavin Nassif- Wiki, Girlfriend, Height, Net Worth, Career</a></h3>American famous kid Gavin Nassif hails from that country.
