Ron Popeil took over marketing the products from his father, recorded the products chopping vegetables, and then broadcast the videos. And thus the infomercial was born. His direct marketing company, Ronco, has become one of the most successful of its kind in the world. He is widely recognized for his many infomercial appearances, and for his catch phrases, which include "Set it, and forget it!" when selling the Showtime Rotisserie set, and "But wait, there's more!", which has become a pop culture buzz phrase. The Showtime Rotisserie did over $1 billion in sales in total during its run.</p><p>Ron Popiel is cousins with actress/singer Ashley Tinsdale and her sister Jennifer.</p><p>Company Sale: After several years of declining sales, Ron Popeil sold Ronco in 2005 to a Denver based company called Fi-Tek Viaa for $55 million. As part of the sale he was paid a salary to be the company's spokesman. This would not prove to be a successful venture, as Ronco filed for bankruptcy in 2018.</p><p>Real Estate: In 2014 Ron listed his 150-acre Santa Barbara ranch for just under $5 million. In 2009 he listed a Beverly Hills home for $6 million. He ultimately did not find buyers for either property and still owns them today.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeipLtuvM6pnKKkXaOytXnWqKmtoF1nhHl8kW8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
