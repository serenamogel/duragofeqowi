After suffering a number of blowups over the years, Giudice and Gorga reached their breaking point, and the resulting hostility may be enough to see <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gorga booted from the show</a>. There’s still no news on if she’ll be returning for season 14 — following rampant rumors that her time on RHONJ is up — but many fans, and Giudice herself, believe Gorga is on her way out.</p><p data-characters=605 data-current-count=605 data-injectable=true>Then there’s Giudice, whose own dramatic history is weighing her down in the wake of that discordant reunion. She and husband Luis Ruelas came under a microscope, over the course of the season, and that scrutiny didn’t let up when the cameras stopped rolling. Reports that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ruelas hired a private investigator</a> to look into the other members of the cast, paired with heaps of personal drama, left the cast (and fans) with a sour taste in their mouths as the season rolled to a close. Ruelas is now subject to his own investigation, of sorts, as longtime fans eye the businessman’s history.</p><h2 id=h-luis-ruelas-net-worth data-injectable=false>Luis Ruelas’ net worth</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/Luis-Ruelas-Teresa-Giudice.jpg><p data-characters=317 data-current-count=617 data-injectable=true>Anyone able to tie down one of the Housewives is all but guaranteed to live a comfortable life, and Ruelas is no exception. Giudice moved on from a 20-year marriage with her former husband, Joe Giudice, to be with Ruelas, and after enjoying a successful, decades-long career, she was never going to pick just anyone.</p><p data-characters=287 data-current-count=287 data-injectable=false>Ruelas is a businessman and entrepreneur who, according to a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">social media post</a> from charity JL Blessings, helped to feed more than 300 Harlem families during the pandemic. The 48-year-old co-founded Digital Media Solutions and serves as executive vice president of business development.</p><p data-characters=263 data-current-count=550 data-injectable=true>That job is enough to earn Ruelas a net worth of around $2 million, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according</a> to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple sources</a>. His wealth has been reported higher, at several points in the past, but the consensus of $2 million may be in the wake of his charitable work through the pandemic.</p><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=282 data-injectable=false>Ruelas is worth a fair bit more than his new wife, who’s earned a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">still-enviable $500,000</a> through years of work in the reality television sphere. Between the two of them, and their promising future earnings, it seems safe to say that the Ruelas/Giudice family is set for life.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2TEqa3TZqCsZZyqtrR50a6cpZmjYrumwIywpqusmGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
