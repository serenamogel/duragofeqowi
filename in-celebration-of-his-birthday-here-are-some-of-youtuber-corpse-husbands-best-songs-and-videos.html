Recommended Videos One of YouTube’s rare mega-popular faceless creators, Corpse has never shown his face on-stream. He remains a mystery to all but a rare few, with no known images of him populating the web. An image that supposedly revealed his face circulated in 2021, but Corpse has never verified it as the real deal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He remains a mystery to all but a rare few, with no known images of him populating the web. An image that supposedly revealed his face circulated in 2021, but Corpse has never verified it as the real deal. Considering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the response</a> the image got, who can blame him?</p><p data-characters=592 data-current-count=959 data-injectable=true>Over nearly a decade on YouTube, Corpse Husband has built a sprawling brand for himself. After starting out with a focus on horror narration — something he pulls off wonderfully, thanks to his uniquely deep voice — Corpse branched out into video game streaming and music. He became a household name in 2020, when his Among Us streams started to take off, and released his debut single the same year. In the years since, he’s maintained star status among YouTube’s best, releasing a range of streaming videos, horror narrations, and fresh musical pieces to his adoring fanbase.</p><h2 id=h-corpse-husband-s-10-most-popular-youtube-videos data-injectable=false>Corpse Husband’s 10 most popular YouTube videos</h2><p data-characters=508 data-current-count=508 data-injectable=true>Corpse Husband has produced a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">wealth</a> of popular content over the years, with more than a dozen musical releases under his belt and several handfuls of videos with view counts in the millions. Many of his earlier videos are less popular, but as Corpse grew more confident in his YouTube offerings, his viewers responded. More recent videos on his page are regularly popular, but some skyrocket far above others. From least to most popular, here are 10 of the most-viewed videos on Corpse Husband’s page.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>10. True Horror Stories Animated Compilation (5.3 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=460 data-current-count=760 data-injectable=true>It’s still got a view count in the low millions, but of his most popular videos, this delightful horror offering has the least views in total. A 32-minute compilation of some of Corpse’s favorite horror stories, this video rises above many of his other horror uploads due to the animated accompaniment. The stories gain a whole new level of eeriness when paired with the stellar animation made in collaboration with several other YouTube regulars.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>9. True Scary Stories (5.5 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=636 data-injectable=true>One of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">two</a> horror offerings with the same 5.5 million views, we selected this one as a longtime favorite of ours. It compiles five terrifying — and reportedly true — scary stories for viewers to enjoy. When read in Corpse’s husky, measured baritone, it adds a level of creepiness that other creators simply can’t match.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>8. Sykkuno And I GASLIGHT The Lobby And Create A GRAVEYARD (10 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=601 data-injectable=true>It’s not his most popular Among Us stream — by a long shot — but this particular Among Us video is worth a watch by all of Corpse Husband’s many fans. At 31 minutes long in total, it’s the perfect quick entertainment for fans of Corpse and Innersloth’s 2018 release alike.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>7. Horrifying Search and Rescue Stories (11 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=546 data-injectable=true>Another video that emphasizes Corpse’s horror roots, this video leans into a more specific scope than many of his more broad offerings. It takes aim at search and rescue stories, in particular, and delivers plenty of chills in the process.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>6. 666 IQ Best Among Us Imposter Clutch You Will Ever Watch (13.5 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=577 data-injectable=true>Fans can learn a lot about Among Us from a Corpse Husband stream.

At a full 47 minutes in length, it’ll take more time to complete than the majority of his videos, but it’s well worth every minute.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>4. Horrifying Deep Web Stories (19.4 million views)</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Leaning once again on his horror roots, Corpse Husband’s most popular scary story upload has a whopping 19 million views.
