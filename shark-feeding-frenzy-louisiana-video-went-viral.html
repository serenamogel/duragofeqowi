In fact, things like tires, license plates, a fur coat, a chicken coop, and even a full suit of armor have been found in their stomachs! But generally, sharks are omnivorous, which means usually they just eat meat and plants. If there is not an abundant supply of meat in the area, they will resort to eating sea vegetation,”</strong> the agency said.</p><p>May and his girlfriend, Kaitlyn Dix, were fishing on a friend’s fishing boat when they saw the sharks feeding.&nbsp;</p><p>They drove the boat towards a large menhaden pod, but the sharks found it and pushed it against the ship to feast on it.&nbsp;The frenzy was so intense that the sharks brought water into the boat.</p><p>The video footage of the scene shows several gray fins flopping in the water as the frenzied sharks feasted around the boat.&nbsp;</p><p>The video has prompted hundreds of comments online, with many users expressing their fear of being in such a situation.</p><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><span class="tve-leads-two-step-trigger tl-2step-trigger-0"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t7XZmpqaZpOkunC%2Fx5qppGWWmrKltc2gZJ%2BqlaPHunnLqKyiq5mWu6J51aKbnqddrLKvwIyvoKuZnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
