In fact, it's through theatre that he polished his English.&nbsp;</p><p>Now, if you ever find yourself watching "That '70s Show" again, even if Fez's character is a bit of a mystery, you at least know the guy playing him has a rich multi-national background, which may or may not add to the context of the jokes and puns.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmcmlibIZye9OhnGatnqm8rbCMramurJhivKd51qKjnZ2iYsOiuMOeqauZnZZ8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
