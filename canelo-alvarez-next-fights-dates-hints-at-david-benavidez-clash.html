The Mexican boxing superstar's reaction comes in the wake of the announcement of a multiyear deal between his current promoter, Premier Boxing Champions (PBC), and Amazon's Prime Video.</p><p>This agreement signifies a shift in broadcasting, as PBC fights and pay-per-views (PPVs) were previously aired on Showtime, which is set to conclude its boxing programming by the end of the year.

Alvarez debunked recent reports suggesting possible matchups against Jaime Munguia, Jermall Charlo, or Terence Crawford, stating, "Right now my dates are May and September. Those are the dates that I always look to fight. This Monday I’m gonna have a meeting with Al Haymon and see what’s next."</p><p>Alvarez dismissed the mentioned opponents, expressing surprise at the circulating names. He explained that he has been occupied with other aspects of his life, including managing his businesses and traveling with his wife. The interview suggests that Alvarez is focused on his upcoming meetings to determine his next steps in the boxing ring and that no concrete plans or discussions about opponents have been made at this time.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <a class=dc-img-link href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thesportsterimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/terrence-crawford.jpg> </a><span data-field=label class=article-card-label>Related</span><h5 class=display-card-title><a href=#>Terrence Crawford Names Canelo Alvarez In Next Two Fights Before Retirement</a></h5><span data-field=excerpt class=article-card-excerpt>Terrence Crawford announces his plans before retiring from boxing and it includes Canelo Alvarez.</span><h2 id=alvarez-hints-at-fighting-david-benavidez-in-september>Alvarez Hints At Fighting David Benavidez In September</h2><h3 id=canelo-dismissed-david-benavidez-as-a-threat>Canelo Dismissed David Benavidez As A Threat</h3><p>In response to David Benavidez's demand that he vacate the WBC super-middleweight title if a fight doesn't materialize, Canelo Alvarez asserted his position, stating, "Look, a lot of things can be said, but, at the end of the day, at this moment I’m the king and I can do what I want." Alvarez is indicating that he holds the leverage to make decisions about his career.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When initially asked about a potential matchup with Benavidez in September, Alvarez adopted a more measured approach, stating, “We’ll see. Like I’ve said, always, I’m here to make the good fights. If that’s a good fight for September, or he has to wait a little bit, we’ll see. At the end of the day, sometimes the fights are bigger when you have to wait a little bit.” This suggests that while Alvarez acknowledges the possibility of facing Benavidez, the timing and circumstances may play a role in determining when the fight will eventually take place.</p><p>Alvarez compared Benavidez to other opponents he was urged to fight in the past, such as Erislandy Lara and Gennady Golovkin, whom he ultimately defeated.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErKeoqqSowaa%2BjZympmeTlrumuM5mmKWukaeyu3nNnq%2BtZZaetKnA0mabmqyVqHqptc2tqmaZpGKxosLInWSbnZ6Ww6qwxLNknKSRqLVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
