You want to eat healthy foods but you also want dessert dessert, and fruit just isn’t going to cut it. Behold the solution to your (very specific) problem: dips for fruit. And don’t worry if you are not well versed in this world of fruit dipping, because what we have below is a list of the best dips for fruit that are sure to get your fruit-dip creativity flowing. By the end of this article, you will be an expert in what to dip fruit in. A dipmaster, if you will. A dipster? Anyway, let’s dip in.</p><p>(Side note: I didn’t include whipped cream because I think of that as more of a topping than a dip, but if you want recs for that, check them out <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>).</p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Baker’s Real Milk Chocolate Dipping Chocolate</strong></a><p>I mean, this one is a given. There’s nothing more classic than strawberries dipped in chocolate, and this dipping chocolate makes it so easy. It’s microwavable, y’all. And it tastes great, too! Managing editor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gwynedd Stuart</a> wrote that this stuff is like “melted Hershey’s Kisses, but smoother. It’s so rich and thick that it really clings to a dunked strawberry.” Senior writer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jordan Myrick</a> said this is their family’s go-to for strawb’ dippin’. You truly can’t go wrong with this one.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Chocolate for Dipping Strawberries This Valentine’s Day</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Boar’s Head Dark Chocolate Dessert Hummus</strong></a><p>Now, I know a lot of people have trouble with the concept of chocolate dessert hummus. And while it may not be everyone’s cup of tea (er…chickpeas?), it is a great, protein-filled way to enjoy fruit, and a lot of people really love it. Jordan said this Boar’s Head Dark Chocolate hummus is the only chocolate hummus they would ever eat, and described it as “creamy, thick, and chocolatey.” If you’re still dubious, check out the next dip on the list…</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Only Chocolate Hummus I’d Ever Eat</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Chocolate Bitchin’ Sauce</strong></a><p>This nut-based sauce truly is as bitchin’ as it claims to be, kind of like a chocolate hummus but better. Jordan said it “tastes like straight-up brownie batter (without the salmonella warnings from your mom),” and now I can’t stop imagining it on strawberries, raspberries, apples, bananas, and more. It’s certainly one of the best dips for fruit out there. A real game changer!</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Every Flavor of Bitchin’ Sauce, Ranked</a></strong></p><strong>&nbsp;</strong><p>I know, what?! A cream cheese? I promise I am of sound mind, just hear me out for one second: cheesecake. Okay now do you see it? Sweet Strawberry cream cheese with fresh sweet berries—ugh, it would taste like heaven. Throw in some graham crackers and you’ve got yourself a deconstructed cheesecake that would make even the fanciest chefs jealous. And they make “deconstructed” things all the time. Plus, this has “big pieces of actual fruit folded into the cream cheese,” which Jordan loved. Take our word for it, this stuff is grand.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cream Cheese: 7 Creamiest, Tangiest, Best Cream Cheeses</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Pillsbury Creamy Supreme Chocolate Fudge Frosting</strong></a><p>This one is for when you truly just want to eat chocolate frosting with a spoon but social norms and a healthy dose of “I’m an adult, so I guess I should be healthy idk” get in the way. Here’s a hack though: Use a piece of fruit as your spoon and just eat the frosting. Then you will get your frosting fix, plus, when you do eventually eat the chocolate frosting-covered fruit, it will be absolutely delicious. Jordan called this frosting “better than any other frosting we tried”—chocolatey, creamy, rich, and oh-so silky smooth. You will not regret this one.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Best Cake Frosting: The Best Frosting at the Grocery Store Might Surprise You</a></strong></p><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Litehouse Old Fashioned Caramel Dip</strong></a><p>It wouldn’t be a list of the best dips for fruit without a caramel dip for apples. Honestly, in terms of “what to dip fruit in,” this Litehouse fruit dip certainly falls in the top three for me. It is thick, smooth, luscious, and deeply caramelly, like someone’s mom just made this on the stove with nothing but sugar, butter, and love (though I know for a fact it contains many more ingredients than that). I could (and have) eaten this stuff with a spoon out of the container, but it is even better with apple slices. And if you really want an S-tier experience, try this on a crisp fall day while wearing a sweater and sitting by a fireplace with a mug of mulled cider.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaJqVqMFusMipqmaen6d6p77Uoqto</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
