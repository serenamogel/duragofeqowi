Phrases like IB (Inspired By) or moots (mutuals) are all a part of the fast-growing Gen Z dialogue. Although one particular TikTok phrase has ruffled some feathers, that phrase being RCTA or ECTA. So what exactly does the acronym stand for and why has it got so many people upset?</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=302 data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false>Let’s cut to the chase, RCTA stands for Race Change To Another, or Ethnicity Change To Another if we’re talking about ECTA, (It’s the same thing.) Those who are RCTA are trying to actively change their own race/ethnicity because they believe that they identify with said race more than their own.</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=541 data-injectable=true>Of course, this has been branded as problematic, and for good reason. Some of the defense for RCTA likens it to being transgender. Firstly, no, it’s not akin to transgenderism, not even close. Race is inherited attributes, gender is not.</p><p data-characters=453 data-current-count=453 data-injectable=true>A person who is trans may have a male body but a female gender identity; clearly there’s a disconnect between their body and who they really are. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Male and female brains are different</a> so it’s possible to be born with your brain being one and your body another. But you can’t be white and born with the brain of another race, because when it comes to the brain there is nothing that inherently makes it one race or another like there is with gender.</p><p data-characters=170 data-current-count=170 data-injectable=false>Furthermore, there are plenty of scientific studies and academic research that validate transgenderism. One TikToker pointed out that there are no such studies into RCTA.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=470 data-injectable=true><a title=@skymochi64 href=#>@skymochi64</a><p>I recently learned about RCTA (race change to another) (it’s like being transgender) (it’s not trans racial I swear) (I love trans people, if you don’t like me you don’t like transgender people) and these are my thoughts!!! <a title=rcta href=#>#rcta</a> <a title=rctaisvalid href=#>#rctaisvalid</a> <a title=rctaisvalidgocry href=#>#rctaisvalidgocry</a> <a title=rctacommunity href=#>#rctacommunity</a> <a title=trans href=#>#trans</a> <a title=transgender href=#>#transgender</a> <a title=viral href=#>#viral</a> <a title=uwu href=#>#uwu</a> <a title=kawaii href=#>#kawaii</a> (/j)</p><a title="♬ thank you for using my sound - haechan's lover" href=#>♬ thank you for using my sound – haechan’s lover</a></figure><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Most of the issues surrounding those who call themselves RCTA are the fact that many of these perceived behaviors from other races are based on stereotypes. For example, one TikTok boils Japanese culture down to their looks, food, and fashion. Most people don’t need this spelled out for them, but changing your own features and lifestyle to fit into the stereotypes of a particular race is racist.</p><p data-characters=413 data-current-count=413 data-injectable=true>But hold on, it gets even weirder because we’re going to talk about “face claiming.” Essentially a face claim is a model who represents an ideal version of the race an RCTA person wants to be. They can be models, celebrities or just random TikTokers who the person thinks looks the most like how they themselves want to look. Sometimes they even reach out to other users to ask if they can claim their face.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@wtsoda href=#>@wtsoda</a><p>i do care tho- literally be yourself and stop fetishing us. dont use my face for your fantasies anf fetishes its weird. <a title=06 href=#>#06</a> <a title=wtsoda href=#>#wtsoda</a> <a title=rcta href=#>#rcta</a> <a title=asian href=#>#asian</a></p><a title="♬ you are you i am me - leila" href=#>♬ you are you i am me – leila</a></figure><p data-characters=219 data-current-count=519 data-injectable=false>The whole idea has now sort of been hijacked by people who are satirizing it. But you’ll still find plenty of genuine videos of people trying to change their own race, or giving others tips on how to do so themselves.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8uLTArWSiq12ptaZ50ZyrmmWdmq6vtc2gZKimXam2rMDOpGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
