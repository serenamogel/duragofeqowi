In the mid-‘60s, he developed a relationship with Norman Scott (Whishaw), someone very much at the other end of the socioeconomic ladder. At least as it’s captured here, Norman was something of an acquisition for Jeremy, someone he could protect and predict. Tired of the danger of illegal one-night stands with men, Norman was something he could control. Until he couldn’t. After the two split, Norman became the secret for Jeremy that wouldn’t go away. And so he tried to have him murdered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.rogerebert.com/redactor_assets/pictures/5b369061b8b50d3e3f9a0c4d/content_VES3.jpg><p>A character in the phenomenal third episode (the series starts strongly and only gets better) says that “This is the story of a liar meeting a fantasist.” Norman was the kind of young man who partied constantly and told stories to try and impress people around him. Whishaw perfectly portrays this man’s fascinating combination of vulnerability and strength. He gets that Norman honestly loved Jeremy, and that plays into why he refuses to be considered a fling. The look in his eyes when one of Jeremy’s colleagues who knows about the relationship verbally recognizes the honest emotion of it is poignant. Norman is a man who has been dismissed by everyone and was then seen by one of the most powerful men in the country. He refuses to let that go. In some ways, it's all he has.</p><p>On the other side of this remarkable acting achievement is the work of Hugh Grant, having one hell of a year with this and “<a href=#>Paddington 2</a>” (he should work with Whishaw, the voice of Paddington, all the time). Here, Grant is not only perfectly cast—his movie star looks conveying the powerful social position of his character—but he seems to fully understand the push and pull within Jeremy. Nothing is more important than his reputation and his political career, and it’s when his illegal love (homosexuality was illegal when they started dating) threatens his career that he lashes out. He would rather be dead than outed.&nbsp;Norman becomes a situation that he thought he completely controlled that ends up controlling him, and Grant captures that aspect of this fascinating story with remarkable subtlety. This could have been an exaggerated caricature of an awful&nbsp;man overrun with power, but Grant finds a way to make Jeremy engaging instead of merely a villain. And yet he never goes for sentimentality either. We come not to like Jeremy but to at least understand part of what he did, and that’s quite an accomplishment. It may be Grant’s best performance.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7s7vGnqmempWnwW%2BvzqZmrKyimq6utc2gZpplppq%2FunnEp56loaOderSvwKebmqRdnsBuu82eZKieXam1pnnBnqqtZaSdtq%2Bz0mawqK2coXq4rdOcn2asmJ7AbsXEmqk%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
