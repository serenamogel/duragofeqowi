Recommended Videos The Lacey Fletcher case — or the woman in Louisiana who was found dead and “melted” into a couch — was back in the news in 2024 when Fletcher’s parents, Sheila and Clay Fletcher, appeared in court and changed their plea related to Fletcher’s death. In 2022, Fletcher, who was 36 when she died, was discovered where she had reportedly been sitting for 12 years, so long that the cushions on the couch had started to decompose from Fletcher’s feces and urine."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

She had a bone infection and had developed severe ulcers all over her body. Maggots grew in the sores, likely while Fletcher was still alive, according to <a href=#>The Daily Beast</a>.</p><p data-characters=307 data-current-count=307 data-injectable=false>Medical examiners determined that Fletcher, who was diagnosed on the autism spectrum with severe social anxiety, died from sepsis and “poor hygiene, prolonged immobility, and malnutrition as a result of severe chronic neglect of a special needs individual,” according to the coroner’s office.</p><p data-characters=223 data-current-count=530 data-injectable=true>It’s now thought that Fletcher, who weighed less than 100 pounds when she died, also lived with <a href=#>locked-in syndrome</a>, a rare neurological disorder&nbsp;causing muscle immobility except for muscle movements in the eyes.</p><h2 id=h-fletcher-s-parents-were-indicted-on-second-degree-murder-charges data-injectable=false>Fletcher’s parents were indicted on second-degree murder charges</h2><p data-characters=347 data-current-count=347 data-injectable=false>In 2022, Sheila and Clay Fletcher were indicted on second-degree murder charges, although they said they were innocent and that Lacey was “of sound mind” when she refused to leave the couch.

One year later, a Louisiana grand jury reopened the case, according to <a href=#>The Advocate</a>.</p><p data-characters=336 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>According to Sheila and Clay, they did what they could care for their daughter while she was still alive. Their defense attorney, Steven Moore, said, “It is clear they were negligent. They loved her to death — that is the true statement with the Fletchers. They loved their daughter to death,” according to <a href=#>The New York Post</a>.</p><p data-characters=52 data-current-count=52 data-injectable=false>According to <a href=#>victim advocate, Dana Lovett</a>, however:</p><p>“Nobody should have to have lived like she did all these years.
