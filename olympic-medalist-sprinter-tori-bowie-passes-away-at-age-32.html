She was 32 years old.</strong></p><p>The death of Bowie was announced by her management company and USA Track and Field on Wednesday. There was no cause of mortality listed.</p><p>“USATF is deeply saddened by the passing of Tori Bowie, a three-time Olympic medalist and two-time world champion,” USA Track and Field Chief Executive Officer Max Siegel said in a statement. Her influence on the sport has been immeasurable, and she will be deeply missed.</p><p>According to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office in Orlando, Florida, deputies responded Tuesday afternoon to a residence in the area “for a well-being check of a woman in her 30s who had not been seen or heard from for several days.”</p><p>The sheriff’s office reported that a woman, “tentatively identified as Frentorish “Tori” Bowie (DOB: 8/27/1990),” was discovered deceased inside the residence. There were no indications of wrongdoing.”</p><p>Bowie, who grew up in Sandhill, Mississippi, was persuaded to participate in track as a teenager and ascended rapidly through the ranks as a sprinter and long jumper. She attended Southern Mississippi, where she captured the 2011 NCAA indoor and outdoor long jump championships.</p><p>Bowie earned silver in the 100-meter dash and bronze in the 200-meter dash at the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro. She then raced the anchor leg on the gold-winning 4×100 relay team alongside Tianna Bartoletta, Allyson Felix, and English Gardner.</p><p>In London in 2017, she won the 100-meter event at the world championships. In addition, she assisted the 4×100 team win gold.</p><p>Track coach Craig Poole, who worked with Bowie early in her career and later on, remarked,</p><p><strong>“She was a very enthusiastic, vivacious individual.” She was a delight to collaborate with.</strong></p><p>On social media, the track and field community lamented the passing of Bowie. Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce, a Jamaican sprinting sensation, posted on Twitter,</p><p><strong>“My heart aches for Tori Bowie’s family. A formidable rival and source of illumination. Your vitality and smile will remain with me forever. Rest in serenity.”</strong></p><p>American hurdler Lolo Jones added,</p><p><strong>“Too immature. Sad to learn about Tori Bowie’s passing. Incredible aptitude. A gorgeous runner. I pray for the well-being of her family, and I thank you for bestowing her upon us. The running community is in mourning over a tragic loss.”</strong></p><p>Brittney Reese, a three-time Olympic medalist in the long jump, wrote:</p><p><strong>“I am so devastated… You have made many of us pleased, thank you for representing our state of Mississippi so admirably… Rest in peace!”</strong></p><p>As a neonate, Bowie was taken in by her grandmother after being abandoned at a foster home. She viewed herself as a basketball player and reluctantly participated in track, but Bowie was a quick learner and won state titles in the 100, 200, and long jump before attending college.</p><p>Her first significant international medal was a bronze for 100 meters at the 2015 World Championships. After winning, she stated,</p><p><strong>“My grandmother always told me I could accomplish anything I set my mind to.”</strong></p><p>Icon Management included a photograph of Bowie holding her hands in the shape of a heart in a tweet. The management firm wrote,</p><p><strong>“We’ve lost a client, a loyal friend, a daughter, and a sister. Tori was a champion…an incredibly dazzling beacon of light. Our deepest condolences and sympathies are with the family and friends.”</strong></p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
