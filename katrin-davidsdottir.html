She was born to <strong>David Costin</strong> (father) and <strong>Odda Helgadottir</strong> (mother).</p><p>Their parents or siblings have always inspired the majority of the CrossFit athletes on the pinnacle. However, this wasn’t the case for Katrin Davidsdottir.</p><p>Katrin, as a child, aspired to be like her grandfather. She used to stay by his side every time. She even tried to pee while standing up once.</p><p>Her grandfather was the former ambassador of Iceland to the United States, Denmark, and England. Moreover, he was a well-known lawyer who instilled a passion for law from the age of six.</p><p>Similarly, she was incredible in her academics. Katrin excelled at arithmetic throughout school, never scoring below 95%. In addition, she enjoyed solving puzzles at home.</p><p>In an interview with CrossFit games, she revealed impressing a mathematician family member. She utilized Pythagorean’s Theorem to understand a complex math problem.</p><p>You might like to know about the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>12 Best Female Weightlifters of all Time</a></strong></p><h2>Katrin Davidsdottir | Professional Career</h2><h3>Talent vs. Passion</h3><p>The majority of her childhood revolved around admiring her grandfather. She loved solving mathematics and had a passion for gymnastics from an early age.</p><p>Similarly, she knew that she would excel in anything involving numbers, math, or physics. Therefore, she enrolled at the University of Iceland in 2012. Katrin had decided to study engineering as her major.</p><p>But, something felt off for Katrin Davidsdottir. Despite being extremely good, she became bored with the program. As a result, she switched to law after only one year.</p><p>Likewise, Katrin enjoyed the lectures and class discussions. However, essays and readings were more difficult for her to keep up with. Katrin found it incredibly difficult to sit down and read.</p><p>Consequently, she struggled to maintain her academic standing. The case imitated a talent vs. passion debate. By the time she was working on assignments, her mind would wander to finding another passion.</p><p>It seemed destiny had other plans for her. Unfortunately, after being inspired by her grandfather, the path she chose didn’t look as if it was meant for her.</p><h3>A New Passion</h3><p>Katrin’s mind was wandering to find something new to pursue. She had pursued gymnastics for more than ten years at that point. Moreover, she enjoyed the challenge it posed.</p><p>Eventually, she found out about CrossFit joining CrossFit BC in 2011. Katrin’s previous training as a gymnast helped her a lot in the transition.</p><p>One year into transition, she debuted in the professional scene for the first time. Her debut couldn’t have been any more impressive.</p><p>Katrin ranked second in the European Regional in the Individual Women category. This result meant she qualified for the CrossFit games 2012 in her first year as a professional.</p><p>She secured 30th position in the CrossFit games and 21st rank in the Worldwide Open. Katrin was motivated more than ever. 2013 was all about covering up the gap between the athletes at the top as she trained harder than ever.</p><p>Consequently, she qualified for the CrossFit games 2013 as she finished third in the European regionals. Moreover, she improved her rank to 24th in the CrossFit games the same year.</p><h3>Finding and Repeating Glory</h3><p>2014 would be her worst year as a professional, as she missed out on qualifying for the CrossFit games. Katrin finished sixth in the European regionals.</p><p>Further, the Worldwide Open rank slipped to 122nd, the first time she was out of the top 50. After that, she knew she had to work hard to gain her form back to winning ways.</p><p>Even in the most incredible fall, it’s the warrior that rises again to fight. Katrin was a warrior by heart as she increased her training and nutrition to prepare for 2015.</p><p>Consequently, she qualified for the CrossFit games securing second in the Meridian Regional. The CrossFit games 2015 would forever be memorable for her as she was crowned the Fittest on Earth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/katrin-davidsdottir-2-1024x556.png><p>She had secured the top position for the first time. As a result, she climbed to 14th in the Worldwide Open.</p><p>Katrin also looked to continue this form in 2016, as she moved to the United States. This change didn’t bother her at all.</p><p>Firstly, she began the year by qualifying for the CrossFit Games 2016, securing first in the East Regional. Then she went on to win the CrossFit Games 2016 again.</p><p>Katrin had done it. She was the Fittest on Earth for two years in a row. She was the second athlete to repeat the feat as a champion.</p><h3>An Engaging Career</h3><p>Katrin was the back-to-back CrossFit Games Champion. But, the most challenging part of being the top is to stay at the pinnacle.</p><p>She didn’t let the two consecutive wins get her to the head as she prepared for 2017. She qualified for the CrossFit games 2017, securing the second position in the East Regionals.</p><p>However, she couldn’t repeat the feat for the third time as she finished fifth in the CrossFit games. But, her performance was applauded by fans from all over the world.</p><p>What followed in the years to come was inhumane levels of consistency. Katrin secured two podiums finished between 2018 and 2020, barely missing out in 2019.</p><p>Katrin finished 2018 securing a podium finish in the CrossFit games. She held the third position in the Games and finished 10th in the Worldwide open.</p><p>Similarly, she barely missed out on her fourth podium after securing the fourth position. Nonetheless, she rose again almost to clinch the 2020 CrossFit games as she finished 2nd in the event.</p><p>Katrin had made it clear to the world that she was not just an average CrossFit athlete. Her dedication and unreal consistency earned her a lot of fans.</p><h2>Katrin Davidsdottir | Nutrition and Training</h2><p>Katrin needs to keep fit and healthy as a professional athlete at the top of her game. So, as per an interview in Men’s Journal, she discusses her macros with her dietician and nutritionist.</p><p>She weighs and measures her meals. Therefore, she knows how much protein, carbohydrates, and fat to consume.</p><p>Similarly, she has always been terrified of carbohydrates. She was confident that if she ate carbohydrates, she would gain weight.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/katrin-davidsdottir-3-1024x576.jpg><p>Every day, it takes her around two hours from when she arrives at the gym until she finishes her workout.</p><p>At one point, she was so dedicated to training that she relocated to Boston. Moreover, she got full-time training with Ben in New England.</p><p>Rope climbs had always been a significant weakness of hers, and she was unable to compete in the 2014 Olympics due to the same. However, she has been working hard on it.</p><p>Also, she focuses on all upper-body pulling exercises like muscle-ups, rope climbs, and pull-ups. Then, she works on general strength exercises like squats and deadlifts.</p><h2>Is Katrin Davidsdottir Married? | Know About Her Marital Status</h2><p>Katrin Davidsdottir is in a relationship, according to many sources.
