Stanton didn’t mince words about the three figures on the poster; he presumed guilt for not just Booth, whom he referred to as “the murderer of our late beloved president,” but the two accomplices as well. The poster continued:</p>“Let the stain of innocent blood be removed from the land by the arrest and punishment of the murderers.
