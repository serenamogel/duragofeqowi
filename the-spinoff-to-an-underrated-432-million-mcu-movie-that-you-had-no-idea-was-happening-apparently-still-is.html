On top of directing Avengers: The Kang Dynasty and likely Shang-Chi 2, it was also reported (by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>) that he will helm a Disney Plus spin-off as well, which was said to be built around Shang-Chi’s sister Xialing, as played by Meng’er Zhang.</p><p data-characters=284 data-current-count=284 data-injectable=false>Things had gone cold on that front since then, so we pretty much forgot all about it, but according to the latest intel, the Xialing show was still in development at the House of Ideas prior to the strikes taking effect. So, as far as we know, it remains a-go. As per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Updates</a>:</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/tweet_1694403125417771185_20230824_125807_via_10015_io.png><p data-characters=389 data-current-count=389 data-injectable=false>Coming out when theaters were still recovering from the pandemic, Shang-Chi only made $432 million at the box office (tremendous for any other studio, not outstanding for Marvel), but it was warmly received by the fandom and has gone down as one of the best-reviewed of the MCU’s origin stories. So it’s no surprise that a sequel and a spin-off supposedly remain in the works.</p><p data-characters=511 data-current-count=900 data-injectable=false>There’s certainly lots to explore with Xialing in her own vehicle, given that she took over from her father, Wenwu (Tony Leung), as the new leader of the Ten Rings organization in Shang-Chi‘s post-credits scene. She’s now one of the most powerful people in the criminal underworld of Earth-616, then, so the storytelling and crossover potential there is extremely intriguing. Even so, with Cretton’s commitments to Avengers 5, any expansion of the Shang-Chi-verse is likely a ways away.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqqmhnqSzp3nTqGSapl2qu6Wx0auYrZ2UYoF0foymoKWkmaS7brnCrmSmp6aesm7Ax5qrZrGfqnqprcNmpahlmZmyonnWmqpmoJGlvaa6yKeeZpmgpa6zsc2to7Jlo6m2rbiMoqpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
