These two moves cause the user to faint upon using them, but, does the user's Sturdy prevent it from fully fainting? JetanHertz13 19:02, 11 December 2009 (UTC) No, Pokémon with Sturdy will still faint if their HP is reduced to 0 by means other than OHKO moves. Damp is the ability that negates explosive moves. —darklordtrom 22:18, 13 December 2009 (UTC) Question I have a question."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I was battling Roark in Round 2, and my Gallade's drain punch activated Probopass's Sturdy. Next turn, Roark used a full restore. I used drain punch again, and instead of surviving at 1 HP, Probopass directly fainted. It may be that the situation with healing items needs to be looked into separately from other methods of fully healing HP.</p><p><a href=# class=new title="User:Shrewstur (page does not exist)">Shrewstur</a> (<a href=# title="User talk:Shrewstur">talk</a>) 01:56, 28 January 2022 (UTC)</p><h2><span id=Brock.27s_Rhyhorn></span><span class=mw-headline id="Brock's_Rhyhorn">Brock's Rhyhorn</span></h2><p>Why does it say <a rel=nofollow class="external autonumber" href=#>[1]</a> Brock's Rhyhorn has Sturdy in HGSS gym battle, while on his page it says it's Rock Head?--<b><a href=# title="User:Team Rocket Grunt"><span>Rocket</span></a> <a href=# title="User talk:Team Rocket Grunt"><span>Grunt</span></a></b> 16:11, 5 March 2022 (UTC)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX4murbeZjKuuqpSurGmNwaKjoqypXg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
