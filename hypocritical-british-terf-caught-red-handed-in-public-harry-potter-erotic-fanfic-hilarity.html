The story comes to us via X, where user @dschw69 found themselves sat near Helen Joyce, director of the anti-trans campaign group Sex Matters. Joyce, who published the 2021 book Trans: When Ideology Meets Reality (described as ‚Äúalarmist‚Äù and criticized for being anti-semitic) was working on her phone with her screen visible to other passengers:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I see the words ‚Äúsingle-sex spaces‚Äù and some other TERF dog whistles and think ‚Äúew, but whatever‚Äù.

As the replies quickly pointed out, Joyce is reading an erotic story about children in public, only taking time away from it to approvingly retweet J.K. Rowling.
