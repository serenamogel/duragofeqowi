They’ve been deemed “diet food” and the stench of that has rocked their reputation for years. I’m here to change that. Rice cakes can actually be good!

Stop googling “what to eat with rice cakes” and use this list to guide you to crunchy nirvana. All these recipes using rice cakes (I’m using the word “recipes” generously) are quick, easy, and can be eaten for breakfast, lunch, dinner, or a snack. Are these things versatile or what?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rice-cakes-canned-tuna-mayo-kimchi>Rice Cakes + <a href=#>Canned Tuna</a> + <a href=#>Mayo</a> + <a href=#>Kimchi</a></h2><p>Top rice cakes with a mixture of canned tuna, mayonnaise, and kimchi to make a quick and crunchy rendition of a tuna kimchi onigiri (aka Japanese rice balls). Obviously, Japanese Kewpie mayo is preferred, but any mayo will do. The combo of tuna, mayo, rice, and kimchi will make you feel like you’re at a 7-Eleven in Japan (if you know, you know).</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rice-cakes-french-onion-dip-roast-beef>Rice Cakes + <a href=#>French Onion Dip</a> + <a href=#>Roast Beef</a></h2><p>If you’re looking for a lighter option than a sandwich, try this creamy, caramelized onion and roast beef rice cake! It’s packed with protein and has tons of flavor from the French onion dip. This is one of the simplest recipes using rice cakes, but it tastes like it’s something that took forever to prepare thanks to the roasting of the beef and the low and slow cooking of the onions in the dip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rice-cakes-pimento-cheese-pickles>Rice Cakes + <a href=#>Pimento Cheese</a> + <a href=#>Pickles</a></h2><p>Growing up, I regularly made myself cheese and pickle sandwiches when my parents were at work. I know they sound weird, but they’re so good. They’re rich because of the pimento cheese, and the pickles are the perfect acidic bite to cut through the fattiness of the cheese spread. If you’re wondering what to eat with rice cakes, I’ll tell you right now: It’s pimento cheese and pickles.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rice-cakes-plain-cream-cheese-canned-apple-pie-filling>Rice Cakes + <a href=#>Plain Cream Cheese</a> + <a href=#>Canned Apple Pie Filling</a></h2><p>Is sweet more your style when it comes to what to eat with rice cakes? Make this cream cheese and apple pie rice cake. You can warm up the apples or use them straight from the can. It’s creamy, fruity, and perfect for a quick and easy dessert.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rice-cakes-refried-beans-avocado-salsa>Rice Cakes + <a href=#>Refried Beans</a> + <a href=#>Avocado Salsa</a></h2><p>Creamy beans and tangy avocado salsa (make sure to use a thick and chunky one) pair perfectly with the crispy rice cake. If you use vegan refried beans, this topping for rice cakes is totally plant based.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiroKS%2FrLHDZ5qopV%2BWv7W1wqWcaK%2BYlsFuwM5mnJqsXaS7br7InJxmm5GgsrR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
