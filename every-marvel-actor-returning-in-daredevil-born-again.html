Speaking of…</p><h2 id=h-daredevil-charlie-cox data-injectable=false>Daredevil (Charlie Cox)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Charlie-Cox-Matt-Murdock-Daredevil-e1679423515882.jpg><p data-characters=386 data-current-count=686 data-injectable=true>Well, it wouldn’t be Daredevil without the Hornhead himself, would it? I guess the title Born Again could’ve suggested a recast but the Marvel fandom would’ve launched an insurrection if Charlie Cox was replaced. As it is, the show marks Cox’s fourth post-Netflix return, following Spider-Man: No Way Home, She-Hulk: Attorney at Law, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">(all too briefly)</a> Echo.</p><h2 id=h-kingpin-vincent-d-onofrio data-injectable=false>Kingpin (Vincent D’Onofrio)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/echo-kingpin-post-credits-1.png><p data-characters=377 data-current-count=677 data-injectable=true>What good is a hero without his nemesis? Yes, of course Vincent D’Onofrio will be back as Kingpin in Born Again. Interestingly, Wilson Fisk has probably had a more substantial arc since DD ended than Matt Murdock has, thanks to the exploration of his twisted parental bond with Maya Lopez in both Hawkeye and Echo. Expect <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fisk to run for Mayor of New York</a> in the series.</p><h2 id=h-punisher-jon-bernthal data-injectable=false>Punisher (Jon Bernthal)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Netflix-Punisher-Jon-Bernthal.jpg><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=747 data-injectable=true>As weird as it sounds, the Punisher is coming to Disney Plus! While the jury’s still out on whether <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the rest of the Defenders will ever return</a>, Jon Bernthal has long been part of Born Again as Frank Castle. It’s unknown exactly how much he’ll be in the show, or even if his role will change amid its creative reset, but with former Punisher writer Dario Scardapane as showrunner, you’d expect him to get a meaty storyline.</p><h2 id=h-bullseye-wilson-bethel data-injectable=false>Bullseye (Wilson Bethel)</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Wilson-Bethel-Daredevil-Season-3.jpg><p data-characters=383 data-current-count=683 data-injectable=true>Netflix’s Daredevil ended before Benjamin Pointdexter could fully transform into Bullseye, but it looks like Wilson Bethel might just get a chance to don the classic costume after all as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he’s back for Born Again</a>. He’ll reportedly appear in three episodes of the run, which isn’t a huge amount but should hopefully be enough to pay off his arc in DD season 3.</p><h2 id=h-karen-page-deborah-ann-woll-rumored data-injectable=false>Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll) — RUMORED</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Karen-Page.jpg><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true>Once upon a time, Deborah Ann Woll and Elden Henson were confirmed not to be involved with Born Again in any capacity. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rumored plot details</a> then alleged that Matt Murdock’s best pals Karen and Foggy would be revealed to have died prior to the events of the series. This naturally resulted in a Kingpin-sized backlash. And apparently Marvel has learned its lesson…</p><h2 id=h-foggy-nelson-elden-henson-rumored data-injectable=false>Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson) — RUMORED</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Foggy-Daredevil.jpg><p data-characters=407 data-current-count=707 data-injectable=true>Yes, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">if you believe the rumors</a>, the creatively retooled Born Again will bring back both Woll and Henson as Karen and Foggy. Again, this has yet to be confirmed, but Marvel had better hope this is actually the case lest the fans are cruelly given hope before it’s snatched away again. A word of warning, though: presumably the characters won’t be regulars but will appear in some recurring role.</p><h2 id=h-vanessa-fisk-sandrine-holt-recast data-injectable=false>Vanessa Fisk (Sandrine Holt) — RECAST</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/sandrine-holt-terminator-genisys.jpg><p data-characters=404 data-current-count=704 data-injectable=true>Vanessa Fisk is a unique case in Born Again as, while the character is returning, she will be recast. Ayelet Zurer played Wilson’s wife in the first and third seasons of Netflix’s Daredevil, but the role has been passed on to Sandrine Holt for the Disney Plus show. There’s nothing sinister about the switch, however, as Zurer’s believed to have left due to scheduling conflicts.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>New cast members</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1178455277-1.jpg><ul data-current-count=885 data-injectable=true><li>Margarita Levieva – Heather Glenn</li><li>Michael Gandolfini – Daniel Blade</li><li>Nikki M.

Margarita Levieva is on board as Heather Glenn, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Daredevil’s 456th love interest in the MCU</a> (no judgement — you do you, Matt), while Michael “Son of The Sopranos‘ James” Gandolfini is Daniel Blade. Nikki M. James is also on board as Matt’s fan-favorite ally from the comics, Kirsten McDuffie.</p><p data-characters=69 data-current-count=69 data-injectable=false>Watch out for Daredevil: Born Again on Disney Plus sometime in 2025.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ymwsSrsGalkafDpriMmpqtp6Jiv6bA1KuloqaXYravecOaqZ6clau2rXnBqKmnZZGcrqq6jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
