The tour announcement comes after Yeat was missing from all of the hottest hip-hop festival lineups, telling his fans that his absence from Rolling Loud and other big shows will make sense soon. While he will certainly make his way to the Rolling Loud stage one day, he's kicking off this leg of his career with some headline shows, bringing his frequent collaborator SeptembersRich along for the ride as support."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Throughout the month, Yeat and SeptembersRich will make stops in Philadelphia, New York City, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, and other major zones across the United States.</p><p>After making such a big name for himself in the last year, <a href=# rel>Yeat has solidified himself as one of the most obvious breakout artists of this year</a>. With a post-Whole Lotta Red sound and charisma for miles, Yeat is positioning himself to become a music superstar. His shows are known to get pretty rowdy so if you're buying a ticket to the 2 Alivë tour, be aware of what you're getting yourself into. Rage responsibly.</p><p>Tickets go on sale starting Friday, March 18 at 10 AM local time. Will you be getting <a href=# rel>tickets to see Yeat</a>?
