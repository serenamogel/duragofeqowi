On a recent episode of PBS’ genealogy series Finding Your Roots, the actor discovered that his bloodline has some royal connections, though he was quick to distance himself from his very distant relatives."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

On a recent episode of PBS’ genealogy series <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Finding Your Roots</a>, the actor discovered that his bloodline has some royal connections, though he was quick to distance himself from his very distant relatives. So, in a question this writer thought might never be asked, is Bob Odenkirk really <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">King Charles III</a>‘s cousin?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/bob-odenkirk-nobody.jpg><h2 id=h-is-bob-odenkirk-really-king-charles-iii-s-cousin data-injectable=false>Is Bob Odenkirk really King Charles III’s cousin?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>As revealed on Finding Your Roots’ most recent episode, Bob Odenkirk really is related to the newly crowned King Charles III. Odenkirk and the monarch are found to be eleventh cousins, connected through the actor’s fifth great grandfather. Finding Your Roots host&nbsp; Henry Louis Gates Jr. traced Odenkirk’s genealogy back five generations to one Friedrich Carl Steinholz, who was born in Plön, Germany in 1755.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=395 data-current-count=395 data-injectable=false>That man’s mother, Maria Catharina Bein, conceived him out of wedlock (gasp!) with the Duke of Plön, who was related to the royal families of Europe due to intermarriage (a messy fact not covered in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Crown</a>). For those tracing the threads, while distant enough to ensure he won’t be attending any royal funerals, this means Odenkirk is a cousin to King Charles III on his father’s side.</p><p data-characters=435 data-current-count=830 data-injectable=true>The actor revealed he didn’t have much knowledge of this side of the family since his father, Walter, left the family when he was 15 years old. While this writer might’ve already been drafting letters to Prince Harry (perhaps more like love letters), Odenkirk had a stern reaction to news of his royal roots. The actor affirmed his status as an American, and said he wasn’t a monarchist and doesn’t “believe in that.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=692 data-injectable=true>Odenkirk said that while he understands why “society built itself around” monarchs, he thinks we have ultimately “gotten to a better place” with democracy (a system some might argue is still shaky at best). In any case, maybe Odenkirk got a whiff of what a fancy royal soiree might be like, since he later joked that he might “change his mind” on his monarchy beliefs.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>Odenkirk isn’t the only celebrity to discover his monarchical ancestry. In a 2019 episode of Finding Your Roots, Good Morning America star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Strahan</a> discovered that he was related to King Charlemagne, the first Emperor of the Romans who is also related to King Charles III. Maybe Hollywood royalty and actual royalty aren’t so distant after all?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2S2tHnBqJlmp5Sau6y10aRkq52Robm6ecqipaBlk52us7jErGSioZmoeqS71Kygp2c%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
