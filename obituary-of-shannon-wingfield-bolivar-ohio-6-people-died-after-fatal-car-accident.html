However, the specific cause is still under investigation for further clarification.</span></p><p><span>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has deployed an experienced team of investigators to the scene to collaborate with local law enforcement. NTSB Chair Jennifer Homendy stated that experts will concentrate on gathering and analyzing data from the involved vehicles’ dash cameras, as well as other physical evidence, to shed light on the sequence of events.</span></p><p><span>The investigative team anticipates being on-site for 5-7 days to meticulously examine and gather evidence. Subsequently, a preliminary report will be released in a few weeks to provide initial insights into the accident’s cause. This stage is crucial for elucidating the incident before delving into a more extensive investigation.</span></p><h3><span>Community Response to the Accident</span></h3><p><span>The horrific accident on Interstate 70 has profoundly shaken and dismayed the entire Newark town community and its surrounding areas. Immediately following the tragedy, an emergency prayer vigil was held at the Tuscarawas Valley High School stadium.</span></p><p><span>Thousands of residents, parents, students, teachers, and school staff gathered to participate in the ceremony.
